//  Letâ€™s create a more complex model. Imagine the following situation:
//
//    I put my food into the oven and after some time it ready to eat and produces
//  delicious smell with probability 0.3 and otherwise it is still raw and produces no
//    smell with probability 0.7. If there are delicious smells the cat comes to
//  harass me with probability 0.8, and otherwise it stays asleep. If there is no
//    smell the cat harasses me for the hell of it with probability 0.4 and otherwise
//  stays asleep.
//
//    Implement this model and answer the question: if the cat comes to harass me what
//  is the probability my food is producing delicious smells (and therefore is ready to eat.)
